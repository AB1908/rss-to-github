* It's almost October, so it's time to gear up for this year's annual Obsidian October event. The theme is "Back to School" (best creation for college students, graduate students, and specific subject matter will earn bonus prizes) and they've expanded the categories to include: new plugin (or significant update), video, demo vault, or written content. Here's the 
 [daily progress and learnings](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-october-2022-daily-progress-and-learnings/43767) thread, and the 
 [official hub page](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Events/Obsidian+October+2022). There's more clarification in Discord. If anyone is looking to contribute to an existing plugin, the 
 [Hub has collected some issues of interest](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Contributing+to+the+Community/Plugins+seeking+help).
